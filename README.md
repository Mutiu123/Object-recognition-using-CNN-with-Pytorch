## Project Description:
In this project, I aim to build a robust **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model capable of classifying images from the **CIFAR-10 dataset**. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images across ten different classes (e.g., airplanes, cars, birds, cats, etc.). The goal is to create an accurate image classifier that can identify these objects with high precision.

## Applications:
1. **Image Classification and Tagging**:
   - The trained model can be used to automatically classify images into one of the ten predefined categories. This has applications in content moderation, organizing photo libraries, and enhancing search engines.
   - For example, an e-commerce platform can use our model to tag product images, making it easier for users to find relevant items.

2. **Visual Search Engines**:
   - By integrating our model into a visual search engine, users can upload images and receive similar images from the CIFAR-10 classes.
   - This technology can enhance recommendation systems, allowing users to discover related products or content.

3. **Quality Control in Manufacturing**:
   - In industries such as automotive manufacturing, our model can inspect product images (e.g., car parts) and identify defects or anomalies.
   - It ensures consistent quality by automating the inspection process.

4. **Medical Imaging**:
   - Adapted versions of our model can be used for medical image classification. For instance, identifying different types of cells or tissues in pathology slides.
   - Early detection of diseases or abnormalities becomes more efficient with accurate image classification.

## Methodology:
1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Obtain the CIFAR-10 dataset, which includes labeled images for training and testing.
   - Preprocess the images by resizing them to a consistent size (e.g., 32x32 pixels), normalizing pixel values, and augmenting the dataset (e.g., random rotations, flips, and brightness adjustments).

2. **CNN Architecture Design**:
   - Choose an appropriate CNN architecture:
     - **ResNet**: Residual networks that address vanishing gradient problems.
   - Determine the number of layers, filter sizes, and activation functions based on the problem complexity.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
   - Initialize the chosen CNN architecture (e.g., using PyTorch's `torchvision.models`).
   - Train the model using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam optimizer.
   - Monitor training loss and validation accuracy to prevent overfitting.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Experiment with hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and dropout rates.
   - Use techniques like learning rate schedules and early stopping to optimize model performance.

5. **Evaluation and Testing**:
   - Evaluate the trained model on the test set using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Visualize the model's predictions and explore misclassified images.

6. **Deployment**:
   - Save the trained model's weights and architecture.
